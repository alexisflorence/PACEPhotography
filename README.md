### 1. A landing page
This is the top page, defined in index.html. It shows all the navigational tools and information needed to naviagte the website and understand the purpose of the site for the buisness.

### 2. One or more navigational elements
I used a Header as a menu for the website. It is always visible even when you scroll. For each button clicked a new html page will open in the same tab. 

### 3. Two or more internal links
These links are in the header of the website. They navigate to a pricing html page, gallery html page, contact html page and a home button. They are all opened in the same tab that you are currently in. 

### 4. One or more external links
The external think is found in the home page. It takes you to the instagram page of the website and opens in a different tab.

### 5. At least one HTML table
The HTML table can be found on the Pricing page. The table is used to describe package options and pricing. 

### 6. At least one interactive or animated component
The buttons in the header menu have an interactive highlight on them. When you mouse over the buttons they change into a different color.

### 7. Attention to responsiveness
I used @media to resize the background and fonts and photos on prospective pages
